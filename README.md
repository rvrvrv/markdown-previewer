# markdown-previewer
Markdown Previewer React Project for FreeCodeCamp

## User stories:
1. I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
2. I can see a preview of the output that updates as I type.

**Hint:** You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself. You can import the [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) for this.
